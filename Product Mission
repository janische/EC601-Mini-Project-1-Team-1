Our product is for restaurant owners and managers who want to know the sentiment of tweets about their menu items or the menu items of their competitors in order to make informed decisions to improve their businesses and maintain a competitive edge.

Our product allows restaurants to get an easy-to-digest analysis of candid feedback about specific menu items without the need for offering incentives for customers to fill out surveys, setting up focus groups, or scrolling through individual reviews on Yelp.

The minimum valuable product (MVP) is a program that takes a company name and a few menu item keywords and displays both the overall distribution of sentiments between the categories of “positive,” “negative,” and “neutral,” as well as the average sentiment score and magnitude for each category.
