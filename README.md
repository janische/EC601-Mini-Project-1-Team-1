# EC602-Mini-Project-1

## Sprint 1
### User story
#### Jonathan's part.   
We, Popeyes (a multinational fast-food restaurant chain), want to know the sentiment (score and magnitude) of tweets about our new burger (chicken sandwich) in the time from when we introduced it until now so that we can determine whether to continue this menu item, and if so, whether it needs to be modified to be made better.

### Architecture Flowsheet
#### Zhou's part.
Load data from popeyes twitter account through tweepy API    
Extract needed information (people's comments about popeyes' new burger) from result    
Import information to Google Natural Language API   
Get results of people's sentiment from Google NL API

### Study the Twitter and Google frameworks
Yeah, we did!   

### Write examples to use at least to get twitter feed and get results from one of the Google modules.
Please go to see tweepyTest1.py for our twitter feed, sentiment_analysis.py for Google API.
